# **Learnershood: AI-Powered Learning Assistant for Kids**  

### **Background and Problem Statement**  
Over 70% of African kids grow up disconnected from their rich cultural heritage, with limited access to resources that teach them about African stories, history, and traditions in an engaging way. Traditional educational tools often lack representation and fail to captivate young learners, leaving a critical gap in cultural education.  

### **Impact and Proposed Solution**  
Learnershood aims to bridge this gap with an AI-powered learning assistant tailored for kids. By using interactive visuals, audio storytelling, and gamified quizzes, the platform makes learning about African culture fun, engaging, and unforgettable. Through this innovative solution, Learnershood not only enhances cultural education but also fosters a deeper sense of identity and pride among young learners.
